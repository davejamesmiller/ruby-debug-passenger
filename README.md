# ruby-debug-passenger

## Background
I wanted to use Phusion Passenger as an Apache module (not standalone) but still
be able to use the interactive Ruby debugger.

Thanks to
[Adam Meehan](http://duckpunching.com/passenger-mod_rails-for-development-now-with-debugger)
I was able to do that, and I decided to make it into a reusable Gem.

## Requirements
This is been tested on:

* Rails 3.2.2
* Ruby (MRI) 1.9.2
* Old Ruby Debugger 0.11.6
* Phusion Passenger 3.0.11

and

* Rails 3.0.14
* Ruby (MRI) 1.9.3-p125
* Debugger gem 1.1.4
* Phusion Passenger 3.0.12 and 3.0.13

and

* Rails 3.2.14
* Ruby (MRI) 2.0.0-p247
* Byebug 1.8.0
* Passenger 4.0.10

It will probably work on other versions, but not on Rails 2.

It may or may not work on Ruby 1.8.

## Installation
Add this to your `Gemfile` if you are on Ruby 2.0

```ruby
gem "byebug"
gem "ruby-debug-passenger"
```

or this if you are on Ruby 1.9

```ruby
gem "debugger"
gem "ruby-debug-passenger"
```

or this if you are on Ruby 1.8, but it hasn't been tested!

```ruby
gem "ruby-debug"
gem "ruby-debug-passenger"
```

Then run `bundle install` to install it.

## Usage
Add `debugger` (for rubies under 2.0) or `byebug` (for rubies from 2.0) anywhere
in your Ruby code that you want to invoke the debugger. Or in an ERB template,
add `<% debugger %>` or `<% byebug %>` instead.

Run `rake debug` to restart Phusion Passenger and connect to the debugger. (You
will be prompted to reload the app in your browser.)
